# NYU-RMP-Extension
A simple chrome extension that scrapes RMP links and display onto the chrome extension so that we don't have to look them up physically on RMP

To Do/Fix:
- Understanding Ajax request. The callback function is currently happening twice, creating bugs in the code.
- Convert JS to Jquery
- Adding features that would append the name of the professor to the webpage

To Run:
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Click Load Unpacked and upload the folder with the code
